## About This Project:

This was a homework assignment as part of the Northwestern Coding Bootcamp. We were given the completed HTML and CSS files and had to build a site with JavaScript that takes accepts user choices in password length and characters, and prints out a randomly generated password based on the parameters.

This website was built with JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

## Summary of Project:

The website creates a random password for a user. The user is asked to enter how many characters they want their password to be, anywhere from 8 to 128 characters. They are then asked, with a confirm, if they want special characters, numbers, upper case letters and lower case letters. The app then gives the user a randomly generated password based on their answers.
